# Manifold Meanshift

C++ implementation of meanshift on riemannian manifolds. Generalizes meanshift from vector spaces to manifolds. To compute meanshift on a manifold, just provide the charting function. 

Matlab wrappers with [demo](https://github.com/rozumden/meanshift/blob/master/matlab/%2BMMS/demo.m) are provided.

### Dependenices
Boost, Eigen3
